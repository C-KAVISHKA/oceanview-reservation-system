# ==============================================================================
# GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow for OceanView Reservation System
# ==============================================================================
#
# PLACEHOLDER: This file will be populated with actual GitHub Actions YAML
# 
# INTENDED CI/CD STEPS:
# ----------------------
#
# 1. TRIGGER:
#    - Push to branches: main, dev
#    - Pull requests to: main
#
# 2. BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
#    - OS: ubuntu-latest
#    - Java: JDK 17 (Eclipse Temurin)
#    - Maven: 3.9.x
#
# 3. BUILD STEPS:
#    a) Checkout code (actions/checkout@v4)
#    b) Setup Java JDK 17 (actions/setup-java@v4)
#    c) Cache Maven dependencies (~/.m2/repository)
#    d) Run tests and build: mvn -B -DskipTests=false clean test package
#    e) Upload test reports as artifacts
#    f) Upload built JAR as artifact
#
# 4. TEST EXECUTION:
#    - Unit tests: Automatically included in 'mvn test'
#    - Integration tests: Run with 'mvn verify'
#    - Code coverage: Generate JaCoCo report
#    - Coverage threshold: Fail if below 80%
#
# 5. CODE QUALITY (OPTIONAL):
#    - Checkstyle: mvn checkstyle:check
#    - SpotBugs: mvn spotbugs:check
#    - SonarQube: For comprehensive analysis
#
# 6. ARTIFACT MANAGEMENT:
#    - JAR file location: target/reservation-system-*.jar
#    - Test reports: target/surefire-reports/
#    - Coverage reports: target/site/jacoco/
#    - Retention: 30 days
#
# 7. NOTIFICATION:
#    - On failure: Notify via GitHub status checks
#    - On success: Mark PR as ready for merge
#
# 8. DEPLOYMENT (FUTURE):
#    - Deploy to staging on merge to dev
#    - Deploy to production on merge to main
#    - Use Docker container for consistent deployment
#
# ==============================================================================
# EXAMPLE MAVEN COMMAND:
# mvn -B -DskipTests=false clean test package
#
# Flags:
# -B              : Batch mode (non-interactive)
# -DskipTests     : false = run tests (default, but explicit)
# clean           : Remove target directory
# test            : Run unit tests
# package         : Build JAR file
# ==============================================================================
#
# TO IMPLEMENT:
# Replace this placeholder with actual YAML workflow configuration
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
#
# Example structure:
# ---
# name: Java CI with Maven
# on:
#   push:
#     branches: [ main, dev ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main ]
# jobs:
#   build:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#       - name: Set up JDK 17
#         uses: actions/setup-java@v4
#         with:
#           java-version: '17'
#           distribution: 'temurin'
#       - name: Build with Maven
#         run: mvn -B -DskipTests=false clean test package
# ==============================================================================

# Placeholder - actual YAML implementation pending
